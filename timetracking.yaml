  description: "The Crewmeister API provides a powerful and flexible way to interact\
    \ with Crewmeister services programmatically. Whether you're looking to integrate\
    \ Crewmeister functionalities into your existing applications, automate complex\
    \ workflows, or build custom solutions, our API offers the tools you need.\n\n\
    - If you are new to the Crewmeister APIs or want a refresher on our common concepts,\
    \ we recommend reading through the General API Guidelines. It covers essential\
    \ information that will help you understand how all our APIs work.\n\n- If you\
    \ are already familiar with the general workings of Crewmeister APIs, you can\
    \ just continue reading.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe **Crewmeister Time Tracking\
    \ API** allows applications to interact directly with Crewmeister's time recording\
    \ and evaluation engine. Its core function is to enable the creation, retrieval,\
    \ and management of employee working times, associated metadata, and the rules\
    \ governing time calculations.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nKey use cases include:\n* **Recording\
    \ Time:** Creating clock-in/out events (`Stamps`) or manually adding calculated\
    \ time entries (`Bookings`).\n* **Retrieving Data:** Accessing raw `Stamps`, processed\
    \ `Bookings`, aggregated `Durations`, or current `DurationBalance` for reporting\
    \ or displaying.\n* **Configuration:** Managing `WorkingTimeModel` rules (target\
    \ hours, breaks), defining `TimeCategory` options for project tracking, or setting\
    \ up `TerminalSetting` configurations programmatically.\n* **Reporting:** Triggering\
    \ the generation of standard `TimeTrackingReport` files based on specified criteria.\n\
    \n## Context within Broader System\n\nThis Time Tracking API acts as the central\
    \ repository and calculation engine for working time within the Crewmeister suite.\
    \ It interacts with other modules by consuming user/crew information (Platform\
    \ API), incorporating leave data (Absence Manager API), and providing calculated\
    \ data for payroll purposes (Salary Export API).\n\n\n# General API Guidelines\n\
    \n## Key Concepts\n\nThe Crewmeister APIs are resource-oriented — **everything\
    \ is modeled as a resource**. Each resource supports a fixed set of operations,\
    \ depending on whether it is read-only or writable.\n\n**All resources** support\
    \ paginated reads.\n\n**Writable resources** can be:\n- Read by ID\n- Created,\
    \ replaced, updated on selected properties, or deleted (individually or in batches)\n\
    \nThe REST API uses JSON for both requests and responses. When sending data, include\
    \ the following header: `Content-Type: application/json`\n\nEvery API call either:\n\
    - Performs the requested operation, following the defined semantics\n- Or returns\
    \ an ApiError object (see Error Handling for details)\n\n## Authentication and\
    \ Authorization\n\nMost API endpoints require authentication, though a few may\
    \ allow limited unauthenticated access. Authentication is handled via a token\
    \ that identifies the caller. The system uses this identity to determine the caller's\
    \ permissions for the requested resource and decides whether access is allowed.\
    \ The caller must send this token with each request.\n\n### Obtain a user token\
    \ with username and password\n\nPOST the following JSON to `/api/v3/auth/user/`,\
    \ with content type `application/json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"username\": \"email@email.com\"\
    ,\n  \"password\": \"pwd\"\n}\n```\n\nYou will receive a JSON response containing\
    \ the token.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"token\": \"eyJ0123AiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9...\"\
    \n}\n```\n\n### Use the token\n\nWhen making API calls, add the header: `Authorization:\
    \ Bearer {token}`\n\n### Responses when authorization is insufficient\n\n**401\
    \ Unauthorized** with empty body in case no token is provided or the token is\
    \ invalid\n\n**Reading with filter:** Empty result\n\n**Reading a single resource\
    \ by Id for which you do not have permissions, deleting or modifying a resource\
    \ for which you have no permissions**\n\nHTTP Status code **404**\n\n```json\n\
    {\n  \"@type\": \"com.crewmeister/ApiError\",\n  \"code\": \"NOT_FOUND\",\n  \"\
    details\": {},\n  \"message\": \"Resource with id 1000000 does not exist or you\
    \ do not have permissions to read.\",\n  \"requestId\": \"c6c971ad485d5cbc12ecc2660231fd2a\"\
    ,\n  \"type\": \"REQUEST\"\n}\n```\n\n**Trying to create a resource for which\
    \ you have no permissions**\n\n**403 Forbidden**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@type\": \"\
    com.crewmeister/ApiError\",\n  \"code\": \"PERMISSION_DENIED\",\n  \"details\"\
    : {\n    \"writeRequest\": {\n      \"id\": null,\n      \"patchData\": null,\n\

    : 0\n  },\n  \"message\": \"No permission for action create on the resource .\"\
    ,\n  \"requestId\": \"8aa4efcfc923bc9b8dcdef2dc23ec187\",\n  \"type\": \"REQUEST\"\
    \n}\n```\n\n## CallerContext\n\nThe CallerContext object carries information about\
    \ who is calling the API and under which conditions. It is optional, yet can impact\
    \ the behavior of the API request. See the CallerContext schema for more details.\
    \ In the REST API, you send the CallerContext as a JSON via the `X-Caller-Context`\
    \ header.\n\n## Error handling\n\nWhen an error occurs, the API always returns\
    \ an ApiError object with a fixed structure. See the schema of the ApiError for\
    \ more details.\n\nThere are two levels of error categories:\n\n**Error type /\
    \ High-level category:** REQUEST error or PROCESSING error\n- **REQUEST** means\
    \ that the server could not provide a proper answer because the request fails\
    \ at fulfilling all the preconditions from the API endpoint contract.\n- **PROCESSING**\
    \ means the server accepts the request as valid and fulfilling the preconditions,\
    \ but due to internal problems cannot fulfill the request.\n\n**Error code / Low-level\
    \ category:** The error code gives more insights into what the reason for the\
    \ error is. Every error code maps to exactly one error type.\n\n## Error codes\n\
    \nEvery ApiError maps to exactly one of those error codes.\n\n| Error Code | Description\
    \ | HTTP Mapping |\n|------------|-------------|--------------|\n| `INVALID_ARGUMENT`\
    \ | The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.\
    \ `INVALID_ARGUMENT` indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the\
    \ state of the system. e.g., a malformed file name). | 400 Bad Request |\n| `NOT_FOUND`\
    \ | Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found. | 404 Not Found\
    \ |\n| `CANCELLED` | The operation was canceled, typically by the caller. | 499\
    \ Client Closed Request |\n| `ALREADY_EXISTS` | The resource that a client attempted\
    \ to create already exists. | 409 Conflict |\n| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | The request\
    \ does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation. | 401 Unauthorized\
    \ |\n| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | The caller does not have permission to execute the\
    \ specified operation. `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for rejections caused\
    \ by exhausting some resource (use `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` instead for those errors).\
    \ `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used if the caller can not be identified (use\
    \ `UNAUTHENTICATED` instead for those errors). This error code does not imply\
    \ the request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies other pre-conditions.\
    \ | 403 Forbidden |\n| `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | Some resource has been exhausted,\
    \ perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.\
    \ | 429 Too Many Requests |\n| `FAILED_PRECONDITION` | The operation was rejected\
    \ because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution.\
    \ For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is\
    \ applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following\
    \ guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`:\
    \ <br/>1. Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call.<br/>2.\
    \ Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified\
    \ test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write\
    \ sequence).<br/>3. Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until\
    \ the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an rmdir fails because\
    \ the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the\
    \ client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. | 400\
    \ Bad Request |\n| `OUT_OF_RANGE` | The operation was attempted past the valid\
    \ range. E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`,\
    \ this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes.\
    \ For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked\
    \ to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate\
    \ `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current file size. There\
    \ is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We\
    \ recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so\
    \ that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE`\
    \ error to detect when they are done. | 400 Bad Request |\n| `ABORTED` | The operation\
    \ was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check\
    \ failure or transaction abort. See the guidelines above for deciding between\
    \ `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. | 409 Conflict |\n| `INTERNAL`\
    \ | Internal errors. This means that some invariants expected by the underlying\
    \ system have been broken. This error code is reserved for serious errors. | 500\
    \ Internal Server Error |\n| `UNAVAILABLE` | The service is currently unavailable.\
    \ This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying\
    \ with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent operations.\
    \ | 503 Service Unavailable |\n| `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | The deadline expired before\
    \ the operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system,\
    \ this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully.\
    \ For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long\
    \ enough for the deadline to expire. | 504 Gateway Timeout |\n| `UNKNOWN` | Unknown\
    \ error. For example, this error may be returned when a Status value received\
    \ from another address space belongs to an error space that is not known in this\
    \ address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information\
    \ may be converted to this error. | 500 Internal Server Error |\n| `UNIMPLEMENTED`\
    \ | The operation is not implemented or is not supported/enabled in this service.\
    \ | 501 Not Implemented |\n| `DATA_LOSS` | Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.\
    \ | 500 Internal Server Error |\n\n## Jobs and asynchronous write operations\n\
    \nOur APIs support both synchronous and asynchronous execution for write operations.\
    \ This allows you to choose the approach best suited for your application's needs,\
    \ particularly for potentially long-running or resource-intensive writes.\n\n\
    So we support two execution modes for writing:\n\n1. **Synchronous (Default)**:\n\
    \  - The API call blocks until the write operation is fully completed or fails.\n\
    \  - The response you receive directly indicates the final outcome of the operation.\
    \ \n  - This is the default behavior if no specific header is provided.\n\n2.\
    \ **Asynchronous**:\n  - The API call immediately returns a `Job` resource, indicating\
    \ that the request has been accepted for processing in the background.\n  - Your\
    \ application does not block while the operation is being performed.\n  - You\
    \ can then poll the `Job` resource to track its status and retrieve the final\
    \ result.\n\nTo execute a write operation asynchronously, include the `X-Write-Async`\
    \ header with a value of `true` in your request. You receive an `AsyncWriteResponse`\
    \ that contains a job. Jobs have a status property that tells in which part of\
    \ the lifecycle hey are:\n  - `WAITING`: the job is waiting to be processed\n\
    \  - `PROCESSING`: The job is currently being processed\n  - `SUCCESS`: the job\
    \ has been processed successfully. The property `responses` contains the result\
    \ as a list of `SyncWriteResponses`.\n  - `ERROR`: the final attempt to process\
    \ the job failed. It will not be tried again. The property error contains the\
    \ `ApiError` that caused it to fail.\n\nJobs itself are resources that have an\
    \ id property, and can be read by ID. This allows to get an updated view on a\
    \ Job, for instance to see if it is already processed.  For a resource endpoint\
    \ `https://...urlPrefix.../A`, the corresponding endpoint for its jobs is conventionally\
    \ `https://...urlPrefix.../A-jobs/{jobId}`."
